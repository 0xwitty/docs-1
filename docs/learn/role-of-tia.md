# Role of TIA

## Paying for blobspace

Celestia’s native asset, TIA, is an essential part of how developers
build on the first modular blockchain network. To use Celestia for
data availability (DA), rollup developers submit PayForBlob (PFB)
transactions on the network for a fee, denominated in TIA.

## Bootstrapping new rollups

Deploying blockchains as easily as smart contracts is a core part of the
Celestia vision. In the modular era, developers no longer need to issue
a token to launch their own blockchain.

Similarly to ETH on Ethereum-based
rollups, developers may _opt_ to bootstrap their chain quickly by using TIA
as a gas token and currency, in addition to paying for data availability.
In this mode, developers can focus on creating their application or
execution layer, instead of having to issue a token right away.

## Proof-of-Stake

As a permissionless network built with Cosmos SDK, Celestia uses
Proof-of-Stake to secure its own consensus. Like in other Cosmos networks,
any user can help secure the network by delegating their TIA to a Celestia
validator for a portion of their validator’s staking rewards.

## Decentralised Governance

TIA staking also allows the community to play a critical role in decentralised governance over key parts of Celestia, such as voting on network parameters and governing the community pool, which receives 2% of block rewards. [click here to go to decentralised governance section]
