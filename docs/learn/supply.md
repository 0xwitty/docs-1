**Circulating supply** is defined as the amount of TIA tokens in
general circulation that have no restrictions on transfer.

**Available supply** is defined as the amount of TIA tokens that are
either part of the circulating supply or are unlocked but subject to
some form of governance to determine when the tokens are
distributed. This includes the unlocked portion of the R&D &
Ecosystem tokens and the tokens set aside for future initiatives.

Locked tokens can be staked. All staking rewards will be unlocked.
