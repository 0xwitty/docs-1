# Decentralised governance

## Network parameters

TIA holders (not just stakers) can propose and vote on governance
proposals to change a subset of network parameters. A complete list
of both the changeable and non-changeable parameters and their
values can be found [here](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/v1.x/specs/src/specs/params.md).
The process for submitting and voting on governance proposals is available [here](../../nodes/celestia-app-commands/#governance).

## Community pool

Starting at genesis, Celestiaâ€™s community pool receives 2% of all Celestia block rewards. TIA stakers may vote to fund ecosystem initiatives as in many other Cosmos SDK chains.
